        "The largest dinosaur ever discovered is believed to be Argentinosaurus, which could reach lengths of over 100 feet.",
        "Some dinosaurs, like the Velociraptor, were actually feathered and closely related to modern birds.",
        "The T. rex had the strongest bite force of any land animal, estimated to be around 12,800 pounds of pressure.",
        "Many dinosaurs were herbivores, including the massive Brachiosaurus, which could eat up to 880 pounds of vegetation daily.",
        "The Stegosaurus had a brain the size of a walnut, despite its massive body.",
        "Dinosaurs lived on every continent, including Antarctica, which was once much warmer and supported lush vegetation.",
        "Some dinosaurs, like the Triceratops, had elaborate head crests and horns that may have been used for display or combat.",
        "The first dinosaur fossils were discovered in the early 19th century, leading to the establishment of paleontology as a scientific field.",
        "Dinosaurs went extinct around 66 million years ago, likely due to a combination of volcanic activity and a massive asteroid impact.",
        "The word 'dinosaur' means 'terrible lizard' and was coined by British paleontologist Richard Owen in 1842.",
        "The smallest known dinosaur was the Microraptor, which was about the size of a crow.",
        "Pterosaurs, often mistaken for dinosaurs, were actually flying reptiles and not true dinosaurs.",
        "Fossilized dinosaur footprints, known as trackways, help scientists understand how dinosaurs moved and lived.",
        "Some dinosaurs, like the Ankylosaurus, had armored bodies and club-like tails for defense.",
        "The Spinosaurus was the largest known carnivorous dinosaur, even bigger than the T. rex!",
        "Dinosaur fossils have been found with preserved skin impressions, giving clues about their texture and appearance.",
        "Fossilized dinosaur eggs have been discovered, revealing that some dinosaurs may have cared for their young.",
